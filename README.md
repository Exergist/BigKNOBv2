QMK files for BigKNOBv2 macropad controller. 




## Key Maps

### Original


### Modified

## Notes
 * My BigKNOBv2 was custom-made by LeafCutterLabs and ordered through [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/955302431/bigknob-a-custom-programmable-macropad?ref=shop_home_recs_3&frs=1&crt=1). 
 * My BigKNOBv2 uses the dented encoder, and the keymap was obtimized around it (YMMV). 
 * BigKNOBv2 has key switches with RGB backlighting (as opposed to RGB underglow for the whole device).
